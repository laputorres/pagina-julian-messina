          <h4>Wage Inequality in Latin America. 2018</h4>
          <p> What caused the decline in wage inequality of the 2000s in Latin America? Looking to the future, 
            will the current economic slowdown be regressive? Wage Inequality in Latin America: 
            Understanding the Past to Prepare for the Future addresses these two questions by reviewing 
            relevant literature and providing new evidence on what we know from the conceptual, empirical, 
            and policy perspectives. The answer to the first question can be broken down into several parts,
            although the bottom line is that the changes in wage inequality resulted from a combination of three forces:
            (a) education expansion and its effect on falling returns to skill (the supply-side story); 
            (b) shifts in aggregate domestic demand; and (c) exchange rate appreciation from the commodity boom and
            the associated shift to the nontradable sector that changed interfirm wage differences. Other forces had 
            a non-negligible but secondary role in some countries, while they were not present in others. These include
            the rapid increase of the minimum wage and a rapid trend toward formalization of employment, which played a
            supporting role but only during the boom. Understanding the forces behind recent trends also helps to shed light
            on the second question. The analysis in this volume suggests that the economic slowdown is putting the brakes 
            on the reduction of inequality in Latin America and will likely continue to do so—but it might not actually reverse 
            the region’s movement toward less wage inequality. </p>

          <h4>Learning Better: Public Policy for Skills Development. 2017</h4>
          <p> The book contends that unless the region develops the skills of its labor force it will be
            hard pressed to compete in today’s rapidly-changing, technological world. It recognizes that 
            learning during the early years is vitally important but argues that learning opportunities are 
            available throughout a lifetime. Importantly, it dismisses the notion that money is the only,
            or even the main, answer. Instead, it suggests that a review of the evidence can point the way
            toward cost-effective policies that better prepare citizens, firms, and countries to meet the 
            challenges of an increasingly competitive economic environment. It reviews the relatively low 
            level of skills in the region and the unequal distribution of those skills within countries. 
            It summarizes the state of spending on skills and the incentives to pursue skills development,
            and presents the case for evidence-based policies as the means to address the problem. Finally, 
            it devotes 5 chapters to analyze the available evidence on skills development policies, highlighting
            what works and what doesn’t across all stages of the life, from early childhood to adulthood.  </p>

          <h4>Latin American Entrepreneurs. Many Firms but Little Innovation. 2014</h4>
          <p> Entrepreneurship is a fundamental driver of growth, development,
            and job creation. While Latin America and the Caribbean has a wealth
            of entrepreneurs, firms in the region, compared to those in other
            regions, are small in size and less likely to grow or innovate.
            Productivity growth has remained lackluster for decades, including
            during the recent commodity boom. Enhancing the creation of good
            jobs and accelerating productivity growth in the region will require
            dynamic entrepreneurs. This book studies the landscape of
            entrepreneurship in Latin America and the Caribbean. Utilizing new
            datasets that cover issues such as firm creation, firm dynamics,
            export decisions, and the behavior of multinational corporations,
            the book synthesizes the results of a comprehensive analysis of the
            status, prospects, and challenges of entrepreneurship in the region.
            Useful tools and information are provided to help policy makers and
            practitioners identify policy areas governments can explore to
            enhance innovation and encourage high-growth, transformational
            entrepreneurship. </p>

          <h4>Economic Mobility and the Rise of the Latin American Middle Class. 2013</h4>
          <p> After decades of stagnation, the size of Latin America's middle
            class recently expanded to the point where, for the first time ever,
            the number of people in poverty is equal to the size of the middle
            class. This volume investigates the nature, determinants and
            possible consequences of this remarkable process of social
            transformation. We propose an original definition of the middle
            class, tailor-made for Latin America, centered on the concept of
            economic security and thus a low probability of falling into
            poverty. The continent has experienced a large amount of churning
            over the last 15 years, at least 43% of all Latin Americans changed
            social classes between the mid 1990s and the end of the 2000s.
            Despite the upward mobility trend, intergenerational mobility, a
            better proxy for inequality of opportunity, remains stagnant.
            Educational achievement and attainment remain to be strongly
            dependent upon parental education levels. Despite the recent growth
            in pro-poor programs, the middle class has benefited
            disproportionally from social security transfers and are
            increasingly opting out from government services. Central to the
            region's prospects of continued progress will be its ability to
            harness the new middle class into a new, more inclusive social
            contract, where the better-off pay their fair share of taxes, and
            demand improved public services. </p>
