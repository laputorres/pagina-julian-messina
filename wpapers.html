          <div id="MWTH" class="collapse"> We study the causal impact of the
            minimum wage on labor market outcomes, household consumption,
            inequality and poverty in Thailand by relying on policy variation in
            minimum wages over time across provinces. We find that minimum-wage
            increases have a large and significant impact on the likelihood of
            working in the uncovered sector among workers with elementary
            education. However, the impact is very small and insignificant among
            other labor market groups. In contrast, the minimum wage has large
            positive effects on the formal sector wages of low-earning workers,
            such as the young, elderly and low educated. Increases in the
            minimum wage are associated with reductions in household poverty and
            consumption inequality at the bottom half of the distribution. </div>

          <div id="Sweden2" class="collapse"> We analyze how labor flows respond
            to idiosyncratic shifts in firm-level production functions and
            demand curves using very detailed Swedish micro data. Shocks to
            firms' physical productivity have only modest effects on firm-level
            employment decisions. In contrast, we document rapid and substantial
            employment adjustments through both hires and separations in
            response to firm-level demand shocks. The choice of adjustment
            margin depends on the sign of the shock: Firms adjust through
            increased hires if these shocks are positive and through increased
            separations if the shocks are negative. </div>

              accounting for the decline in earnings inequality in Brazil,
              1995-2012</a><br>

          </p>
          <div id="FFM" class="collapse"> The Gini coefficient of labor earnings
            in Brazil fell by nearly a fifth between 1995 and 2012, from 0.50 to
            0.41. The decline in earnings inequality was even larger by other
            measures, with the 90-10 percentile ratio falling by almost 40
            percent. Although the conventional explanation of a falling
            education premium did play a role, an RIF regression-based
            decomposition analysis suggests that the decline in returns to
            potential experience was the main factor behind lower wage
            disparities during the period. Substantial reductions in the gender,
            race, informality and urban-rural wage gaps, conditional on human
            capital and institutional variables, also contributed to the
            decline. Although rising minimum wages were equalizing during
            2003-2012, they had the opposite effects during 1995-2003, because
            of declining compliance. Over the entire period, the direct effect
            of minimum wages on inequality was muted. </div>

            Adriana Camacho, Julián Messina and Juan Pablo Uribe <button type="button"

          <div id="COLOMBIA" class="collapse"> A rapid expansion in the demand
            for post-secondary education triggered an unprecedented boom of
            higher education programs in Colombia, possibly deteriorating
            quality. This paper uses rich administrative data matching school
            admission information, socio-economic characteristics of the young
            graduates, standardized test scores pre- and post-tertiary education
            and entry wages, to assess the heterogeneity in the value added
            generated by new higher education programs. Our ﬁndings show that
            once we account for self-selection the penalty of attending a
            recently created program, which initially appeared to be quite
            large, becomes close to zero. </div>

          <p> Minimum Wages and the Uncovered Sector in Low and Middle Income

          <div id="MWU" class="collapse"> We present new empirical evidence on
            the implications of minimum wages for the uncovered sector in
            developing countries, analyzing a unique dataset assembled from a
            set of micro surveys collected in 59 low and middle income
            countries. Our identiﬁcation strategy exploits relative bindingness
            in minimum wages across labor market groups within countries and
            years. The empirical ﬁndings show that a higher minimum wage is
            associated with a larger self-employment share. The eﬀect is
            approximately linear in the relative level of the minimum wage, even
            if higher levels of minimum wages are associated with higher levels
            of non-compliance. The estimated impact of the minimum wage on
            informality is economically signiﬁcant: a 1 percentage point
            increase in the minimum wage ratio is associated with a 0.204
            percentage points increase in the self-employment rate. </div>

          <p> The polarization hypothesis in Latin America: how demand forces

          </p>
          <div id="Polarization" class="collapse"> The objective of the paper is
            to document whether employment and wage polarization occurs in Latin
            American countries. We measure the routine/abstract/manual content
            of jobs in Latin American countries exploiting a novel survey
            conducted in Bolivia, Colombia and El Salvador (STEP, Skills Towards
            Employment and Productivity). Comparing task intensity scores in
            those countries and the U.S. shows that while the abstract content
            of jobs is similar in North- and South-America, the routine and
            manual contents are diﬀerent. We speculate that the reason may be
            that Latin American occupations comprise a more heterogeneous set of
            tasks. Merging occupation-speciﬁc information on the task intensity
            with individual-level data available for Mexico and Chile, we show
            that employment polarization seems to take place in Chile but not in
            Mexico during the 2000s. No evidence of wage polarization shows up.
            Descriptive evidence from cross-sectional individual data on the
            returns to skills in Mexico and Chile suggests that abstract and
            manual tasks have positive returns, the latter being more pronounced
            for older workers, while returns to routine tasks are negative. </div>

          <p> Partial Identification of Treatment Effects in Observational Data

          <div id="Dimitris1" class="collapse"> The identification of the causal
            impact of parental education on children’s school performance is
            affected by the endogeneity of parental education, as well as the
            possibility of sample selection due to children dropping out of
            school. We address both these issues using partial identification
            methods that bound the causal effect of interest in observational
            data under relatively mild assumptions. We apply our methods to
            identify the causal impact of mothers’ education on children’s PISA
            test scores in Argentina. We find that higher levels of maternal
            education substantially increase children’s test scores in the
            middle quantiles of the score distribution. </div>
